# Starter

I've decided to create a Frontend layout starter framework. The goal is to have a light-weight, easy to launch responsive base from which all sorts of projects can be started from.

## General Features
* SASS based
* Four column, Three column, Two Column and One column responsive grids
* Basic styling for buttons, inputs
* Browser reset (normalise)

## Getting Started
You'll need npm to build and test the source code
### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
 
### Compiling
To create a production ready build run
```
npm run build
```
If you want a non-minified build, with sourcemaps, run
```
npm run build:dev
```

## Components
The Starter UI provides styling for the following elements:
* Responsive grid
* Buttons
* Forms - input, textarea, radio, select and fieldset
* Media - image & video
* Text labels
* Basic typography

## Responsive grid

## Browser Support
