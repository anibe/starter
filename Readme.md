# Starter

I've decided to create a Frontend layout starter framework. The goal is to have a light-weight, easy to launch responsive base from which all sorts of projects can be started from.

## Features
* SASS based
* Four column, Three column, Two Column and One column responsive grids
* Basic styling for buttons, inputs
* Browser reset (normalise)
